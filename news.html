            Lenovo took to its official Weibo handle to share the announcement details, the Lenovo Y9000K 2023 Gaming notebook is set to launch on October 23 at 20:00 Beijing Time. The laptop is already available globally for the starting price of 4499 euros.

Lenovo Y9000K 2023 laptop comes with Intel i9-13980HX SoC and Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU. It pairs 32GB DDR5-6400 RAM, a 2TB SSD, and a keyboard with an RGB backlight. Equipped with a liquid cooling system, the gaming laptop is set to offer continuous extreme performance. The efficient cooling system uses a small pump to run water through a network of pipes which dissipates heat effectively.

The laptop bundles a 16-inch Mini LED display with a 3200 x 2000 pixels resolution and 165 Hz refresh rate. It houses a USB Type-C port, HDMI 2.1, SD Card Slot, and a Thunderbolt 4 port.

We expect a similar package for the users in China at quite a similar price tag. It could come in Black and White color options.
